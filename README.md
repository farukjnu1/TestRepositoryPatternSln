🏭 Console App Template with Factory & Repository Patterns

A C# Console Application template demonstrating the use of Factory and Repository design patterns for clean architecture and maintainable code.

This project is designed as a starter template for building scalable applications with dependency separation, centralized data access, and object creation abstraction.

---------------------------------

📋 Overview

This console app shows how to implement:

Factory Pattern – Encapsulates object creation, promoting loose coupling and flexibility

Repository Pattern – Abstracts data access logic, providing a central point for CRUD operations

By using these patterns together, this template can be extended for enterprise-grade applications, in-memory databases, or mock repositories for testing purposes.

---------------------------------

🚀 Features

🏭 Factory Pattern Implementation – Dynamic creation of objects

📦 Repository Pattern Implementation – Centralized in-memory CRUD operations

⚙️ Separation of Concerns – Clear distinction between data access and business logic

💾 In-Memory Storage – Store data temporarily for testing and prototyping

🧩 Reusable Template – Easily extendable for new entities

------------------------------------

🧠 Key Concepts

Factory Pattern: Encapsulates object creation to promote loose coupling

Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic and provides a centralized CRUD interface

In-Memory Storage: Temporary session-like storage for testing and prototyping

Separation of Concerns: Clear division between models, repositories, and factories

-------------------------------------

🧠 Future Enhancements

💾 Add persistent storage with SQL Server or SQLite

🧪 Add unit tests for repository and factory logic

🧩 Extend template for multiple entities and services

🔄 Integrate dependency injection for repositories
